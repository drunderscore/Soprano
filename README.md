# Soprano
Build and visualize Minecraft chat components

## Build

Run `cmake`. I personally use `ninja`, but you could use anything. There should be no platform restrictions -- although it hasn't been tested on anything other than Windows 10.

## Usage

Invoking Soprano without any command-line arguments will open a live JSON editor, and component visualizer. As you type your JSON, you will see the visual output come to life -- errors and all!

You can also invoke with `--help` to get more one-time use options.
